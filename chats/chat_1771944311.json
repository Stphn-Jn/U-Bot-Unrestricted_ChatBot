Here's a simple 'if-else' structure in Java:\n\n```java\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        int x = 10;\n\n        if (x > 5) {\n            System.out.println(\"x is greater than 5\");\n        } else {\n            System.out.println(\"x is not greater than 5\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code prints a different message based on the value of variable `x`. If `x` is greater than 5, it prints \"x is greater than 5\". Otherwise, it prints \"x is not greater than 5\"."}]
